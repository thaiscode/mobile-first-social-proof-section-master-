## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile first

### What I learned

This was my first time with mobile first, which, from my point of view, optimized and decreased my code compared to the first solution. I also learned better how relative units work.

### Continued development

I will keep my development focus on Semantic HTML5 markup, flexbox and CSS Grid, besides starting in javascript.
